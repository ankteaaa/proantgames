	<h2>Music by A-Kure</h2>
	<img src="images/A-Kure_AILogo.png" alt="Music by A-Kure" style="width:400px;">
	<p>The front page now features music by A-Kure. This is all music made by the same person who made Pro Ant Games: Me. Well, in this day and age there isn't anything new in people doing everything themselves. I still do take pride in the creations I have made, also when thinking back on all the time, effort, love and alcohol spent on making them. The target audience for the music was myself. Yup. </p>

	<h2>Pointless Space Shooter</h2>
	<img src="images/game_pointless.jpg" alt="Pointless Space Shooter Screenshot">
	<p>Just published an early version of a space shooter made in Unity. It's inspired by the 80's and 90's games lige R-Type, Sidewinder, Xenon II: Megablast and many others. The music is originally by A-Kure, and all the graphics are assets from craftpix.com, freepik.com and other sites. I hope you enjoy it, even though it's really short and you can't die.	</p>

  <h2>The joy and efficiency of designing (first)</h2>
	<img src="images/blog/penandpaper.jpg" alt="The Joy and Efficiency of Designing (first)" />
	<p>It's very tempting to throw oneself directly into constructing a game without considering much but a first idea. This may be just great if one wants to try out a game mechanic, and to see whether it's possible in code or in prototyping environments like Scratch and GameMaker. 
	<br>
	But it's absolutely excellent to devote time for a decent graphic design, scaling elements, finding the right fonts and planning out the balance of the game in advance. Once a design has been carefully planned and thought through, it's so much easier and so much more fun to code and construct. 
	<br>
	This was definitely the case with this website, which was laid out in Axure first, and coded later. For 2D games I recommend using Illustrator and Axure in conjunction, because you can easily drag elements in, scale them and preview what it looks like in a browser. Axure also provides options for some interactivity, so this calls for further exploration!

	<h2>Dania Games Expo 2018</h2>
	<img src="images/blog/blog_bullseye.jpg" alt="Bullseye" />
	<p>This year's expo at Dania Games was a blast! Ten games made by students were nominated for Game of the Year, and the winner was Bullseye - a PvP game made in the Javascript framework Phaser! The game is a two player PvP arena battle in 2D. 
	<br>
	There were plenty of other impressive games, including Wartime, a VR experience in which you shoot planes from the side of a battleship. The game Ctuhlu in Denmark impressed several vistors with stunning lighting in well crafted 3D levels.
	<br>
	Other games included the side-scrolling mobile game Viking Vandals, a 3D platformer called Paper Hero, and many other impressive games made by students.
