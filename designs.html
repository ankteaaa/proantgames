		<p class="servusP">Servus was a band playing goth versions of popsongs in the style of Evanescence, Within Temptation and Nightwish with inspiration from Rammstein and metal in general. The mood was dark and took inspiration from goth and heavy metal aesthetics, including stone textures, abstract brushes, decorative serif types and black and red colors. Artifacts included a flyer, a website and banners.</p> 
		<p class="servusP">
		The graphics are made in Photoshop using a typeface with extra leading, a Clipping Mask for a stone texture, Bevel and Emboss and Drop Shadow for the large letters. The tagline uses Blend Modes in order to be visible from black to white and back, while showing a splash of red color. The background uses brushes and Layer Effects.</p>
	
		<h3>Dania Games</h3>

			<p>Dania Games is a department and campus in Business Academy Dania focusing on game design and programming educational programmes. The campus building is a building on it's own, with rooms named after spaceships.
		This new identity for Dania Games needed to cover the very broad area of video games, and therefore should not go too much into one specific genre. Instead, video game history was incorporated by going in the direction of a sci-fi theme. The Space Age font was applied (and paid for), and edited slightly, to become the new logo for Dania Games.</p>

	<h2>Moodboards</h2>
	<p>Below are a selection of moodboards showing some styles for your inspiration. Note: These are other people's work, that I have gathered in moodboards to show the repetitious design elements that make the recognizable pattern known as a style. See more boards at Pinterest :)</p>
